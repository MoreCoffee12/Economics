# Purpose and summary

## Introduction

Welcome! This document has topics related to my interest in economics, using R. Most of my experience is in vibration analysis. On the surface, there may not seem to be much common ground between vibration analysis and economic analysis. Yet, many of the tools I apply in vibration analysis time series analysis also apply to economics. In addition, economics handles large sets of data, much like most vibration analysis. Lastly, machine learning and artificial intelligence modeling apply to both vibration analysis and economic data series.

## About this project

This project contains files and information either consumed by or generated by the recession indicators RMD project in R. The source R code lives in [this repository](https://github.com/MoreCoffee12/Economics).

## Data source

The R-language code requires a file called “symbols_catalog.csv” to define the symbols used in the economic calculations. This file should be placed in the directory defined by the path stored in the str.data.dir variable.

A template for this file lives on Robot Squirrel Productions at this [link](https://robotsquirrelproductions.com/download/recession-indicators-symbols/).
